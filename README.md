Hi I'm Cole (he/him) 👋 You can learn more about me here:  

I'm currently a graduate student in the [Green lab](https://greenlab.ca/) at the University of Alberta. 🎓

I work on computational biology, usually related to food webs and disease dynamics, and I'm especially interested in ecological forcasting 📈. I'm also really passionate about open science and computational literacy in the biological sciences, so I teach introductory workshop series in programming and reproducibility methods for undergrad and grad students. 🖥️

Here on my GitHub are all the projects I'm working on, a bit of a mixture of research projects and teaching materials.
