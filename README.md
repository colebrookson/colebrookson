# Hi I'm Cole üëã 

I am a computational biologist, currently a PhD student in the [Carlson lab](https://carlsonlab.bio/) at Yale University, and with the [Verena Institute](https://www.viralemergence.org/). 

My PhD research is mostly thinking about how we can understand and predict viral spillover risk. I also think a lot about food webs, fisheries, and the theory behind ecological forecasting üìà. I also have active research projects on computational pedagogy and metascience regarding publishing and equity in ecology specifically. 

I am extremely passionate about open science and computational literacy in the biological sciences, and I teach introductory workshop series in programming and reproducibility methods for undergrad and grad students. üñ•Ô∏è I built and (sort of) maintain the UofT [R Manual](rmanual) which is a great intro resource for those new to R. 

Here on my GitHub are all the projects I'm working on, a bit of a mixture of research projects and teaching materials. Also even though I'm not a software person by trade, I do love building little tools and fun projects for myself, as well as learning new languages. 

You can learn more about me and my various research projects [here](https://colebrookson.com)

I absolutely love talking about software, statistical quandries, and fun ecological problems. If you think we have similar interests, reach out and let's have a virtual or in-person coffee :coffee: Feel free to call me any pronouns, but I typically use he/him or they/them.
