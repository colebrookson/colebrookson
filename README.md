# Hi I'm Cole (he/him) 👋 

I am a computational biologist, currently working as a graduate student in the [Green lab](https://greenlab.ca/) at the University of Alberta 🎓 and as an ecological modeling consultant on a variety or projects. 

My research is usually related to food webs, fisheries, or disease dynamics, increasingly with interest in ecological forecasting 📈. I also have active research projects on computational pedagogy and metascience regarding publishing and equity in ecology specifically. 

I am extremely passionate about open science and computational literacy in the biological sciences, and I teach introductory workshop series in programming and reproducibility methods for undergrad and grad students. 🖥️

Here on my GitHub are all the projects I'm working on, a bit of a mixture of research projects and teaching materials.
